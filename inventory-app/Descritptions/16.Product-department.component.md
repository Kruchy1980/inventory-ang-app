# The ProductDepartmentComponent Component

##### The product Department Component loks like below

### product-department.component.ts:

import { Component, Input } from "@angular/core";
import { Product } from "../product.model";

<!-- // @ProductDepartment: A component to show the breadcrumbs to a Product's department -->

@Component({
selector: "product-department",
templateUrl: "./product-department.component.html"
})
export class ProductDepartmentComponent {
@Input() product: Product;
}

### procuct-department.component.html:

<div class="product-department">
  <span *ngFor="let name of product.department; let i=index">
    <a href="#">{{ name }}</a>
    <span>{{i < (product.department.length-1) ? '>' : ''}}</span>
  </span>
</div>

##### The thing to note about the ProductDepartmentComponent Component is the ngFor and the span tag.

##### Our ngFor loops over product.department and assigns each department string to name . The new part is the second expression that says: let i=index . This is how you get the iteration number out of ngFor.

##### In the span tag, we use the i variable to determine if we should show the greater-than > symbol.

##### The idea is that given a department, we want to show the department string like:

Women > Apparel > Jackets & Vests

##### The expression {{i < (product.department.length-1) ? '>' : ''}} says that we only want to use the '>' character if weâ€™re not the last department. On the last department just show an empty string ''.

#### This format: test ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse is called the ternary operator.
