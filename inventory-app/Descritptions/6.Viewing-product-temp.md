# Viewing the product with Template Binding

##### Now that we have product assigned to the AppComponent instance, we could use that variable in our view template:

<div class="inventory-app">
<h1>{{ product.name }}</h1>
<span>{{ product.sku }}</span>
</div>

##### Using the {{ ... }} syntax is called template binding. It tells the view we want to use the value of the expression inside the brackets at this location in our template.

##### So in this case, we have two bindings:

• {{ product.name }}
• {{ product.sku }}

##### The product variable comes from the instance variable product on our Component instance of AppComponent .

##### What’s neat about template binding is that the code inside the brackets is an expression. That means you can do things like this:

• {{ count + 1 }}
• {{ myFunction(myArguments) }}

##### In the first case, we’re using an operator to change the displayed value of count.

##### In the second case, we’re able to replace the tags with the value of the function myFunction(myArguments) . Using template binding tags is the main way that you'll show data in our Angular applications.
