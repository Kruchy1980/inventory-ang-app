# Selecting a Product

##### We (eventually) want to support user interaction in our app. For instance, the user might select a particular product to view more information about the product, add edit to the cart, etc.

##### Let’s add some functionality here in our AppComponent to handle what happens when a new Product is selected. To do that, let’s define a new function, productWasSelected:

### app.component.ts:

import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import { Product } from './product.model'

@Component({
selector: 'inventory-app-root',
templateUrl: './app.component.html',
styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
products: Product[] <!-- // Here we will display the products declared in constructor below -->
constructor () {
this.products = [
new Product(
'MYSHOES',
'Black Running Shoes',
'../assets/products/black-shoes.jpg',
['Men', 'Shoes', 'Running Shoes'],
109.99
),
new Product(
'NEATOJACKET',
'Blue Jacket',
'../assets/products/blue-jacket.jpg',
['Women', 'Apparel', 'Jackets and Vests'],
238.99
),
new Product(
'NICEHAT',
'A nice Black Hat',
'../assets/products/black-hat.jpg',
['Men', 'Accessories', 'Hats'],
29.99
)
]
}

<!-- // Here we can add the functionality to to the product showing details os choosen product -->

productWasSelected (product: Product): void {

<!-- // just for check the parameter product will be displayed after selecting product -->

console.log('Product clicked', product)
}

##### This function accepts a single argument product and then it will log out that the product was passed in. This functionality will be used later a little.
