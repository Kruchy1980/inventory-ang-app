# Adding more products

##### In the Viewing the Product with Template Binding, we’re only able to show a single product in our app, but we want to be able to show a list of products. Let’s change our AppComponent to store an array of Product s rather than a single Product:

export class AppComponent {
products: Product[];
constructor() {
this.products = [];
}
}

##### Notice that we’ve renamed the variable product to products , and we’ve changed the type to Product[] . The [] characters at the end mean we want products to be anArray of Product s. We also could have written this as: Array<Product> .

##### Now that our AppComponent holds an array of Product s. Let’s create some Product sin the constructor:

### app.component.ts:

import { Component } from '@angular/core'
import { Product } from './product.model'

@Component({
selector: 'inventory-app-root',
templateUrl: './app.component.html',
styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
products: Product[] <!--// Here we will display the products declared in constructor below -->
constructor () {
this.products = [
new Product(
'MYSHOES',
'Black Running Shoes',
'../assets/products/black-shoes.jpg',
['Men', 'Shoes', 'Running Shoes'],
109.99
),
new Product(
'NEATOJACKET',
'Blue Jacket',
'../assets/products/blue-jacket.jpg',
['Women', 'Apparel', 'Jackets and Vests'],
238.99
),
new Product(
'NICEHAT',
'A nice Black Hat',
'../assets/products/black-hat.jpg',
['Men', 'Accessories', 'Hats'],
29.99
)
]
}
}

##### This code will give us some Product s to work with in our app.
