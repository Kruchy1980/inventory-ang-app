# New application - inventory app

First create the file named procuct.model.ts where will be the one product state coded.

### product.model.ts:

<!-- // here we can provide our procuct mode - create the class with our product -->

<!-- // Class named Product -->

export class Product {
constructor (

<!-- // in constructor of class we are defining of procuct parameters types of data, as public types -->

public sku: string,
public name: string,
public imageUrl: string,
public department: string[],

<!-- //here we are declaring a array of strings -->

public price: number
) {}

<!-- // in the first step we are leaving empty object -->

}

### Explanation

##### We’re creating a new Product class and the constructor takes 5 arguments. When we write public sku: string , we’re saying two things:

• there is a public variable on instances of this class called sku,
• sku is of type string.

#### This Product class doesn’t have any dependencies on Angular, it’s just a model that we’ll use in our app.
