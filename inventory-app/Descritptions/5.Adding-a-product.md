# how to add a product to our application

##### We can create a new Product like this:

### ATTENTION that is only an example

<!-- // this is just an example of how to use Product,
// we'll do something similar in our Angular code in a moment -->
<!-- // first, we have to import `Product` so that we can use it -->
<!-- Firstly import -->

import { Product } from './product.model';

<!-- // now we can create a new `Product` -->

let newProduct = new Product(
'NICEHAT', <!-- our sku -->
'A Nice Black Hat', <!-- our name -->
'/assets/images/products/black-hat.jpg', <!-- our Url -->
['Men', 'Accessories', 'Hats'], <!-- our department -->
29.99); <!--our price -->

##### Our constructor for Product takes 5 arguments. We can create a new Product by using the new keyword.

##### Normally, I probably wouldn’t pass more than a few arguments to a function. Another option here is to configure the Product class to take an Object in the constructor, then we wouldn’t have to remember the orderof the arguments. That is, Product could be changed to do something like this:

new Product({sku: "MYHAT", name: "A green hat"})

##### But for now, this 5 argument constructor is easy to use.

##### We want to be able to show this Product in the view. In order to make properties accessible to our template we add them as instance variables to the Component.

### For example, if we want to access newProduct in our view we could write:

<!-- Import as always -->

import { Product } from './product.model';

<!-- Now creating the class -->

export class AppComponent {
product: Product;
constructor() {
let newProduct = new Product(
'NICEHAT',
'A Nice Black Hat',
'/resources/images/products/black-hat.jpg',
['Men', 'Accessories', 'Hats'],
29.99);

this.product = newProduct;
}
}

## or more concisely:

export class AppComponent {
product: Product;
constructor() {
this.product = new Product(
'NICEHAT',
'A Nice Black Hat',
'/resources/images/products/black-hat.jpg',
['Men', 'Accessories', 'Hats'],
29.99);
}
}

##### Notice that we did three things here:

###### 1. We added a constructor

When Angular creates a new instance of this Component, it calls the constructor function. This is where we can put setup for this Component.

##### 2. We described an instance variable

On AppComponent , when we write: product: Product , we’re specifying that the AppComponent instances have a property product which is a Product object.

##### 3. We assigned a Product to product

In the constructor we create an instance of Product and assigned it to the instance variable
