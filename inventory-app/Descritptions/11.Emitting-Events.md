# Emitting Custom Events

##### Let’s say we want to create a component that emits a custom event, like click or mousedown above. To create a custom output event we do three things:

1. Specify outputs in the @Component configuration
2. Attach an EventEmitter to the output property
3. Emit an event from the EventEmitter , at the right time

##### Here’s an example of how we write a component that has outputs:

@Component({
selector: 'single-component',
template: `<button (click)="liked()">Like it?</button>`
})
class SingleComponent {
@Output() putRingOnIt: EventEmitter<string>;
constructor() {
this.putRingOnIt = new EventEmitter();
}
liked(): void {
this.putRingOnIt.emit("oh oh oh");
}
}

##### Notice that we did all three steps: 1. specified outputs , 2. created an EventEmitter that we attached to the output property putRingOnIt and 3. Emitted an event when liked is called.

##### If we wanted to use this output in a parent component we could do something like this:

@Component({
selector: 'club',
template: `

<div>
<single-component
(putRingOnIt)="ringWasPlaced($event)"
></single-component>
</div>
`
})
class ClubComponent {
ringWasPlaced(message: string) {
console.log(`Put your hands up: ${message}`);
}
}

##### Again, notice that:

• putRingOnIt comes from the outputs of SingleComponent
• ringWasPlaced is a function on the ClubComponent
• \$event contains the thing that was emitted, in this case a string
