# Main informations about creating application and order of particular descriptions.

Just because the app is already created and many of the components are prepared the descriptions are not in correct order but everything we are creating will be descreibed as best as possible by me.

### Components

As I've mentioned before, Components are the fundamental building block of Angular applications. The “application” itself is just the top-level Component. Then we break
our application into smaller child Components.

### GOOD TIP

##### When building new Angular applications, we often follow this process: we mockup the design in wireframes (or on paper) and then we break down the parts into Components.

We’ll be using Components a lot, so it’s worth looking at them more closely.
Each component is composed of three parts:
• Component Decorator
• A View
• A Controller
