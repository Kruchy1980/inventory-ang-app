# Writing the ProductsListComponent Controller Class

##### Back to our store example, our ProductsListComponent controller class needs three instance variables:

• One to hold the list of Products (that come from the productList input)
• One to output events (that emit from the onProductSelected output)
• One to hold a reference to the currently selected product

##### Here’s how we define those in code:

export class ProductsListComponent {

<!-- - @input productList - the Product[] passed to us -->

@Input() productList: Product[];

<!-- - @output onProductSelected - outputs the current
-Product whenever a new Product is selected -->

@Output() onProductSelected: EventEmitter<Product>;

<!-- - @property currentProduct - local state containing
the currently selected `Product` -->

private currentProduct: Product;

constructor() {
this.onProductSelected = new EventEmitter();
}

##### Notice that our productList is an Array of Product s - this comes in from the inputs. onProductSelected is our output.

##### currentProduct is a property internal to ProductsListComponent . You might also hear this being referred to as “local component state”. It’s only used here within the component.

# Writing the ProductListComponent ViewTemplate:

##### The template for product list looks like:

<div class="ui items">
  <product-row
    *ngFor="let myProduct of productList"
    [product]="myProduct"
    (click)='clicked(myProduct)'
    [class.selected]="isSelected(myProduct)">
  </product-row>
</div>

##### Here we’re using the product-row tag, which comes from the ProductRow component, which we’ll define in a minute.

##### We’re using ngFor to iterate over each Product in productList. We’ve talked about ngFor before in this book, but just as a reminder the let thing of things syntax says, “iterate over things and create a copy of this element for each item, and assign each item to the variable thing”.

##### So in this case, we’re iterating over the Products in productList and generating a local variable myProduct for each one.

#### Style-wise, I probably wouldn’t call this variable myProduct in a real app. Instead, I’d probably call it product , or even p . But here I want to be explicit about what we’re passing, and myProduct is slightly clearer because it let’s us distinguish the ‘local template variable’ from the input product.

##### The interesting thing to note about this myProduct variable is that we can now use it even on the same tag. As you can see, we do this on the following three lines.

##### The line that reads [product]="myProduct" says that we want to pass myProduct (thelocal variable) to the input product of the product-row. (We’ll define this input when we define the ProductRow component below.)

##### The (click)='clicked(myProduct)' line describes what we want to do when this element is clicked. click is a built-in event that is triggered when the host element is clicked on. In this case, we want to call the Component function clicked on ProductsListComponent whenever this element is clicked on.

##### The line [class.selected]="isSelected(myProduct)" is a fun one: Angular allows us to set class es conditionally on an element using this syntax. This syntax says “add the CSS class selected if isSelected(myProduct) returns true .” This is a really handy way for us to mark the currently selected product.

##### You may have noticed that we didn’t define clicked nor isSelected yet, so let’s do that now (in ProductsListComponent):

### clicked - procucts-list.component.ts:

### procucts-list.component.ts:

clicked(product: Product): void {
this.currentProduct = product;
this.onProductSelected.emit(product);
}

##### This function does two things:

1. Set this.currentProduct to the Product that was passed in.
2. Emit the Product that was clicked on our output

### isSelected - procucts-list.component.ts:

isSelected(product: Product): boolean {
if (!product || !this.currentProduct) {
return false;
}
return product.sku === this.currentProduct.sku;
}

##### This function accepts a Product and returns true if product ’s sku matches the currentProduct ’s sku . It returns false otherwise.

### procucts-list.component.ts:

import { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from "@angular/core";
import { Product } from "../product.model";

/\*\*

- @ProductsList: A component for rendering all ProductRows and
- storing the currently selected Product
  \*/
  @Component({
  selector: "products-list",
  templateUrl: "./products-list.component.html"
  })
  export class ProductsListComponent {
  // @input productList - the Product[] passed to us

@Input() productList: Product[];

// @output onProductSelected - outputs the current Product whenever a new Product is selected

@Output() onProductSelected: EventEmitter<Product>;

// @property currentProduct - local state containing the currently selected `Product`

private currentProduct: Product;

constructor() {
this.onProductSelected = new EventEmitter();
}

clicked(product: Product): void {
this.currentProduct = product;
this.onProductSelected.emit(product);
}

isSelected(product: Product): boolean {
if (!product || !this.currentProduct) {
return false;
}
return product.sku === this.currentProduct.sku;
}
}

### products-list-component.html:

<div class="ui items">
  <product-row
    *ngFor="let myProduct of productList"
    [product]="myProduct"
    (click)='clicked(myProduct)'
    [class.selected]="isSelected(myProduct)">
  </product-row>
</div>
